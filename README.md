# Getting Started with Create React App

# React Web App

To Run the React Web App:
1. For Client-Server Communication - Setting up a Server using json-server by running following command in terminal:
   json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000
2. Run the application by using command in terminal:
   npm start   

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Information ‚úÖ
This is a React Web App Final Assignment of my Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). The Course name is Front-End Web Development with React by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology From Coursera. In this App, there is a Home page having all the necessary details, About page where the details of leaders are mentioned, Menu page where all the dish details are there, Contact page where the contact details and a feedback form are there. You can login your account. You can comment for any dish you like and also you can give your feedback about the dishes. Also, after submitting the feedback form you will get an alert message on your screen üòÉ

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
